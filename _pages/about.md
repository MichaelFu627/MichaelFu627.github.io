An upcoming graduate student studying at the College of Business and Economics, Australian National University (ANU). Pursuing a Master of Science Degree in the field of statistics, under the supervision of Dr. Simon Bonner and Dr. Jorn Diedrichsen. Highly interested in statistical methodology in operational research. I have completed a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Western Ontario (UWO) with a major in Applied Statistics and a minor in Psychology. My research interests combine methodology development and applications, especially in computational statistics, machine learning, Bayesian Inference and generalized linear modelling. I possess a strong aptitude and passion for collaborating with multidisciplinary scientists to deliver effective and statistics-evident solutions. I find pleasure in solving biostatistical challenges and have a long-term objective to secure an academic role, collaborating with diverse professors and industries.
